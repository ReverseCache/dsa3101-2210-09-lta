git reset --hard @{u}
git clean -df -x
git pull 


#---------------------------------

On windows specify "@{u}" (with double quotes).
specifying @{u} or its verbose form @{upstream} is that the name of the remote repo and branch don't have to be explicitly specified

Next, as needed, use git clean to remove untracked files, optionally also with -x
